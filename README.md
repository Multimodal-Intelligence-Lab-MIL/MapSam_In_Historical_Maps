# MapSam_In_Historical_Maps
Historical maps contain valuable geographic information but pose challenges for automated segmentation due to scarce annotations and distinctive visual styles. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides a strong foundation for segmentation, and MapSAM has shown that lightweight fine-tuning can adapt it to cartographic tasks. In this work, we propose an improved adaptation strategy that enhances performance on historical maps while preserving efficiency. Our method introduces Stochastic Gradient Descent with polynomial learning rate decay, a combined Binary Cross-Entropy and Dice loss with automatic class balancing, and a focused fine-tuning scheme. We further explore unfreezing LayerNorm affine parameters and attention key/value projections to inject domain-specific knowledge. Experiments on two benchmarks—the Swiss Siegfried railway dataset and a vineyard segmentation dataset—show consistent gains over the original MapSAM. Specifically, we achieve about +2\% IoU and F$_1$ improvements, along with smoother line predictions and more accurate parcel boundaries. These results highlight that careful adjustment of optimization, loss, and fine-tuning scope can significantly boost the effectiveness of foundation models for historical map segmentation in low-resource scenarios.
